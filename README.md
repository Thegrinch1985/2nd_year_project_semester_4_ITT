# 2nd_year_project_semester_4_ITT

This was our 3rd project in Java Playframe work. Again with the same team members Philip O'Donovan, Shane McCann and myself, Howard Lynch.
This website was a retail shop that had a front end created with JavaScript , Bootstrap, Html and Css. Then the backend was connected to a database with product details. This was a CRUD application which used the Model view controller. 
To run the application download or clone the repository. Cd into the project folder and in terminal enter activator run. after all file are loaded you should be able to view the website on localhost:9000.
